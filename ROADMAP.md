## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### System Flow

Nigerian Users → USSD (*789#) → VTU Gateway → OUH Backend → Solana Smart Contracts
↓
Mobile Money ← SMS Confirmation ← Price Oracle ← Redis Cache

### Core Components
- **Smart Contracts**: User PDAs, transaction processing ✅
- **Backend API**: USSD handling, VTU integration
- **Infrastructure**: PostgreSQL, Redis, Nginx ✅
- **Integration**: Price feeds, SMS notifications

## 🎯 Weekly Milestones

- **Week 1**: Technical foundation + planning ✅
- **Week 2**: Working smart contracts + backend APIs
- **Week 3**: End-to-end USSD transaction flow
- **Week 4**: Demo-ready product + submission

## ⚠️ Risk Mitigation

### High Risk
- VTU provider integration delays → Start research immediately
- Solana network issues → Extensive devnet testing
- Regulatory compliance → Document legal requirements

### Medium Risk
- Price feed reliability → Multiple API sources
- SMS delivery → Twilio premium account
- Infrastructure scaling → Load testing early

## 🏆 Success Targets

- **Technical**: Working Solana transactions
- **Market**: Nigerian user validation
- **Business**: Clear revenue model
- **Demo**: 3-minute compelling presentation
